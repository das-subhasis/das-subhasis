Hi there! My name is Subhasis Das and I am a B.Tech undergraduate student with a strong background in data analysis.

I have a passion for using technology to solve problems and create efficient solutions. In my current role, I have gained expertise in Data Analysis with Python and have successfully completed projects which are posted below.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest developments in the tech industry and participating in online communities centered around my areas of interest.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to collaborate with others on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or LinkedIn if you have any questions or want to work together.
